    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Tip 120g plain flour and 60g caster sugar into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Add 60g unsalted butter, then rub into the flour using your fingertips to make a light breadcrumb texture. Do not overwork it or the crumble will become heavy.</li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the mixture evenly over a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins or until lightly coloured.</li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, for the compote, peel, core and cut 300g Braeburn apples into 2cm dice.</li>
        <li>
            Put 30g unsalted butter and 30g demerara sugar in a medium saucepan and melt together over a medium heat. Cook for 3 mins until the mixture turns to a light caramel.</li>
        <li>
            Stir in the apples and cook for 3 mins. Add 115g blackberries and Â¼ tsp ground cinnamon, and cook for 3 mins more.</li>
        <li>
            Cover, remove from the heat, then leave for 2-3 mins to continue cooking in the warmth of the pan. </li>
        <li>
            To serve, spoon the warm fruit into an ovenproof gratin dish, top with the crumble mix, then reheat in the oven for 5-10 mins. Serve with vanilla ice cream. </li>
