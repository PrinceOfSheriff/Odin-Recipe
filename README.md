# Odin-Recipe
This is my first odin project and will involve creating a recipe, utilisng my recently gained knowledge of HTML.
I'll be utilising ordered and unordered lists, relative and absolute links and images, as well as other knowledge of HTML that I've gained outside of Odin.
Please don't actually use this recipe, it'll probably make you quite ill.
